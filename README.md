Neumorphism Design Digital Clock

    The Neumorphism Design Digital Clock is a visually appealing clock application that uses the neumorphism design trend. Neumorphism, or soft UI, is a design approach that combines background colors, shapes, gradients, and shadows to create a soft, extruded plastic look, often seen in modern interfaces.

Features
    1. Displays current time in a digital format (HH:MM:SS).
    2. Neumorphic design elements for a modern, aesthetic look.
    3. Responsive design suitable for various screen sizes.
    4. Light and dark mode support.
    5. Easy customization of colors and styles.

Prerequisites
    Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

        1. A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).
        2. Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

Usage
    Once the project is set up and index.html is opened in your browser, the digital clock will display the current time with a neumorphic design.

Customization
    To customize the appearance of the clock, you can modify the CSS in the style.css file. Below are some common customizations:
        1. Colors: Change background and text colors to match your desired theme.
        2. Shadows: Adjust the shadow properties to alter the depth and highlight effects.
        3. Font: Modify the font family, size, and weight to fit your preferred typography.
